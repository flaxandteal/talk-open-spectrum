					<h1>Deep Mining<br/>Start-ups</h1>
					<h3>in 18th Century Cornwall</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
						  <li>the  name  of  the  engineer  entrusted  with  the  engine  and  eventual  remarks  on
						    potentially interesting features of the engine and of its working behaviour. (Nuvolari, 2007)</li>
							<li>The Cornish: Pear's Soap, high-pressure steam engine, the one true fake pasty.</li>
							<li>Mine adventurers, large scale deep mining. Black &amp; white flags. Cusp of first industrial revolution. However, mines go below the water table, and a major limitation was the ability to get water _out_ of mines. This was the first true task of the steam era.</li>

							<li>In 1765, James Watt was working at a University and spotted inefficiencies in the steam engine; he a developed a PoC, spent most of his cash on patenting, and, in 1775, his original backer went bankrupt and an angel investor, Boulton, stepped in to help get him a crack dev team, facilities and build an MVP. A year later, he'd some machines in production, and by 1777 his machines were spreading through the Cornish mining industry, the first true test of steam at scale. Much of installation was at cost, and adventurers paid Boulton &amp; Watt based on their closed IP managed service agreement.</li>
							<li>However, Boulton &amp; Watt's IP claim was broad. It covered all new steam engines, creating a block on independent improvements. They charged steep subscriptions, and when mines were least productive, in the rainy winter, adventurers were paying the highest infrastructure costs, with no clear caps. After the labour in getting the patent, Watt &amp; Boulton did not sublicense and blocked all potential competitors, and all other innovation for almost a quarter of a century.</li>
							<li>The adventurers debated a legal challenge, but finally decided it was unenforceable and started secretly building "pirate engines", thanks to one of the key co-innovators that had made Watt's business possible, James Wilkinson. When discovered, both sides sunk huge time and money, with royalties being stuck in escrow, into trying to get past the IP issue.</li>
							<li>In 1800, the patent ran out. For 10 years, the adventurers just soaked up the benefits of the vanished expense, but then they started getting creative, and practised what they had preached. It turns out Docker isn't the first tech to co-opt nautical terms for open IP projects. Their mines, presumably including the old pirate ones, had "captains", managers, who started an industry publication for all the captains and engineers to release technical improvements and improve best-practice standards industry-wide, as well as to generate a climate of competition between the engineers for publicly contributing innovation, by printing live performance stats for all the engines. An "engine reporter", Lean, was responsible for coordinating all this in that 19th Century Github. Meanwhile Trevithick, of Cornwall's Ding Dong Mine, who previously had an injunction from Watt hammered into his door, invented the high-pressure steam engine, crossing the power-to-weight barrier, and quickly enabling steam trains - he took no patent and instead sold his expertise internationally. Unfortunately for him, while in South America, he got pressed into Simon Bolivar's revolutionary army, but couldn't shoot straight and was eventually allowed to go home.</li>
							<li>The mines created an IP-sharing culture, incorporating each others' innovations, stimulating professional self-improvement in engineers, and focused on their value-add as independent competing service and commodity providers, rather than trying to become technology monoliths. Cornwall's mines suddenly trebled their annual effiency gains, and kept that consistent annual rate of improvement for over thirty years.</li>
							<li>Cornwall's steam innovations went on, thanks to Trevithick, as much as Watt, to become the engine of industrial revolution, and to revolutionize the globe.</li>

Software industry:
    Marco Arment (was lead dev at Tumblr)
    IP, three shades of ineffectual:
        Copyright: minor variation sufficient, essence is not covered
        Patent: costly to obtain and enforce, PR nightmare and dubiously valid
        Trademark: useful, but does not cover ideas
    IT industry, especially small business, needs to find counter-IP streams to survive
---
    Customers paid not for receiving more value, but out of fear of what would happen if they stopped paying. Fear, however, is not a path forward.

    The software industry was ultimately liberated by open source software. This model of open collaboration and sharing delivered what was thought to be impossible: better quality of products at a lower cost for the customer. Open source software combined with ubiquitous cloud services enabled the massive growth in digital businesses that we are witnessing today.

							<li>So, is open access important for industry?</li>
							<li>
							  Yes. And it's not just important for industry, it's important for consumers served by industry, to ensure their products are built with a complete understanding, and not in a commercially or intellectually windowed environment, especially those trusting their lives to technology. It's also, as a result of fostering academia-dependent SMEs, additionally beneficial to researchers through collaborative projects, open source, real-world data collection and provides opportunities for academics to set out as entrepreneurs, without cutting ties to their science.</li>

							<li>In short, open access has enabled a new breed of innovator - one driven by transparency, collaboration and accountability, who doesn't see human knowledge as paywalled, in or out, black or white, but sees all the colours of the open rainbow.</li>

							<li>By expecting members to both lead and support, we have seen understanding gaps subverted, and that level of interdependence enhance reliability. We are able to have projects where a tech team member, not the business analyst, is responsible for signing off deliverables as lead - the analyst is free to represent the client's interests to the scrum team without reservation, and the tech lead is directly financially responsible to the client for ensuring delivery.</li>

						- You shouldn't do both! Not if your products are closed IP, no. But here... Your products cut the feet from under the proprietary vendors, and your services engage the released capital, hand in hand. Of course, it's a devil's pact - you get a huge competitive advantage for your product, but have to compete with third-parties for your services. You've a head start, but if you're inefficient, if you're insecure, if you're ineffective, you get left behind in servicing your own product. If only that was true in closed source, we'd all be better off.
						- Open data provides us with a freely available repository of insights waiting to be discovered, it allows us to show what we can achieve and augment with our client's data, not be dependent on it for proving the concept, or even generating a saleable product
						- And not just an agreed auditor under a mountain of code, behind closed doors
						- Isn't a product's IP what makes it worthwhile? No, rarely, we're not in manufacturing or engineering. If you are depending on copyright, not patent or trademark, if you become successful, someone will build what you have, cheaper, faster and overseas, learning from your design flaws. There's no law against it, and even if they can copy your code, it's probably quicker for them to point a cheap team at it and start from scratch instead.
						- What you're trading on is your quality as a provider, your knowledge of the market, your in-house experience, your user-base, your market position. Don't get caught into IP fights that cost as much to win as to lose.
